## What Find Inspiration Does

Find Inspiration searches for relevant design patterns, proven approaches, and visual references. But unlike a mood board tool, it doesn't show you the inspiration. It uses it internally to produce better outputs. Inspiration informs:

- Layout decisions
- Component patterns
- Visual approaches
- Interaction models
- Industry conventions

## [​](#how-figr-uses-inspiration)How Figr Uses Inspiration

When you ask for a design, Figr automatically looks for relevant patterns and references. This happens in the background to make outputs smarter.

```
Example:
You ask: "Design a pricing page"

Behind the scenes, Figr:
- References high-converting pricing patterns
- Considers industry-standard layouts
- Draws from proven comparison table approaches
- Applies best practices for plan presentation

You get: A pricing page informed by patterns 
that work, not generic guesswork.
```

## [​](#when-inspiration-activates) When Figr Draws on Inspiration

Figr engages inspiration gathering automatically when it helps. You don't usually need to ask for it. **Automatic activation:**

- Designing common screen types (dashboards, settings, checkout)
- Creating standard components (tables, forms, cards)
- Building industry-specific interfaces
- Generating layouts for familiar use cases

**You can also explicitly ask Figr to seek inspiration:**

- "Find inspiration for creative empty states, then design ours"
- "Look at best-in-class onboarding patterns and apply them to our flow"
- "Draw from modern dashboard designs for this analytics view"

## What You Get

You don't see the inspiration directly. You see the result: designs that are informed by proven patterns rather than invented from nothing.

| **Without inspiration**                                           | **With inspiration**                                                                                  |

| Generic layouts, reinvented wheels, patterns that might not work. | Designs grounded in what's proven, informed by industry standards, building on successful approaches. |
