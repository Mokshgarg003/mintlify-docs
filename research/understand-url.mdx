## [​](#what-understand-url-does) What Understand URL Does

Understand URL reads and extracts content from any webpage you share. It processes the text, information, and context on the page, not the visual design. Understand URL extracts:

- Page content and copy
- Article text and information
- Documentation and guides
- Product descriptions
- Feature lists and specifications
- Any textual content

<Tip>
  **Important:** This tool is for content extraction, not visual reference. For visual design reference from a webpage, use the [Chrome Extension](/designing/input/chrome-extension) instead.
</Tip>

  <Accordion title="For Visual Reference, Use Chrome Extension">
    If you want to match styling:

    - **Don't**: "Look at [URL] and match their design"
