### Effective Comment Workflows

<Steps>
  <Step title="Structured Feedback">
    **Use consistent comment formats:**

    ```
    üî¥ Critical: Blocks implementation
    üü° Suggestion: Nice to have improvement  
    üü¢ Approval: Ready to implement
    ‚ùì Question: Need clarification
    ```
  </Step>
  <Step title="Actionable Comments">
    **Good comment examples:**

    ‚úÖ "Move CTA above fold - our analytics show 40% drop in conversion below 600px"\
    ‚úÖ "Use \$color-primary-600 instead of this blue to match design system"\
    ‚úÖ "Consider loading state - this API call takes 3-5 seconds"

    **Avoid vague feedback:**
    ‚ùå "This doesn't look right"\
    ‚ùå "Make it better"\
    ‚ùå "I don't like this color"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Resolution Process">
    **Comment lifecycle:**

    1. Feedback provided with clear action
    2. Designer implements or responds with questions
    3. Reviewer marks as resolved or continues discussion
    4. Final approval before implementation
