Working with your team is better than working alone. **Here's how to bring them in.**

## Open organization settings

Click your profile icon at the bottom left. You'll see your email and credit balance.

/>

**Click "Organization settings."** This opens your team management dashboard.

## Invite team members

You'll see an invite section at the top. **Enter email addresses** of people you want to add. You can invite multiple people at once—just separate emails with commas.

Pick their role:

- **Admin** — Full control over settings, billing, and members
- **Member** — Can create and edit canvases, but can't manage the team

**Click "Send invites."** They'll get an email with a link to join your organization.

## What happens next

Your teammates will receive an invitation email. When they click the link, they'll join your organization automatically. No approval needed from you.

They'll see all shared canvases right away. And they can start creating their own.

## Switch between organizations

Part of multiple teams? Click your profile icon and select "Switch organisation." You'll see all organizations you're part of.
