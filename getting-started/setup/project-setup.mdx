# Project Setup

Setting up your first project correctly is crucial for getting the most out of Figr's product-aware AI. This is where you teach Figr about your specific product, users, and constraints.

<Callout type="info">
**Time investment:** 15-20 minutes of setup saves hours on every future design. Figr learns your product once and remembers forever.

    **Before sharing your screen:**
    - Have your product open in a browser
    - Prepare login credentials for demo account
    - Plan to show 3-4 key user flows
    - Include both common and edge cases
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Screen Share">
    Click **"Share My Screen"** in the project setup
    
    <Callout type="warning">
    **Privacy note:** Only share windows with demo data. Figr doesn't record or store screen sharing sessions.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Product Walkthrough">
    **Recommended flow (10-15 minutes):**
    
    1. **Home/Dashboard:** Show main navigation and key metrics
    2. **Core Workflow:** Demonstrate your primary user journey
    3. **Secondary Features:** Show supporting functionality
    4. **Edge Cases:** Error states, empty states, loading states
    5. **Different User Types:** Admin vs. regular user views
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Narrate Key Insights">
    **As you navigate, mention:**
    - "Users often get confused here..."
    - "This pattern works really well because..."

## Validation & Testing

Before finalizing your project setup:

<Callout type="tip">
**Test your setup:** Create a quick test design to see how well Figr understands your product context.
</Callout>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Create Test Design">
    Ask Figr to design something simple that exists in your product:
    
    "Create a user settings page for our product"
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Evaluate Results">
    **Check if the design:**
    - Uses your actual color palette
    - Matches your navigation patterns
    - Includes features specific to your product
    - Feels consistent with your existing UI
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Refine Context">
    **If the design doesn't feel right:**
    - Add more specific constraints
    - Upload additional reference materials
    - Provide more detailed product context
    - Share additional screen recordings
  </Step>
</Tabs>

## Common Setup Issues

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Design System Not Recognized">
    **Symptoms:** Figr uses generic colors/fonts instead of yours
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Ensure design tokens are in supported format (JSON, CSS variables)
    - Check file names are descriptive (colors.json, not file1.json)
    - Upload a style guide PDF as backup reference
    - Use the "Manual Token Entry" option
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Product Context Too Generic">
    **Symptoms:** Designs look like standard templates
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Provide more specific user scenarios
    - Share actual product URLs (staging/demo)
    - Upload real screenshots, not mockups
    - Describe unique business rules and constraints
  </Accordion>
  
  <Accordion title="Screen Sharing Not Working">
    **Symptoms:** Can't share screen or connection issues
    
    **Solutions:**
    - Try different browser (Chrome recommended)
