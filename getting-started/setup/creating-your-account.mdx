## Sign up for free

Creating your account is quick. **Really quick.** You'll be designing in less time than it takes to make coffee.

### Step 1: Choose how you want to log in

Head to [app.figr.design](https://app.figr.design) and you'll see two options:

- **Enter your email** – We'll send you a magic link
- **Continue with Google** – One click and you're in

That's it. No passwords to remember.

### Step 2: Check your inbox

If you chose email, we've just sent you a login link. It usually arrives in seconds.

<Warning>
  **Can't find the email?**

  Check your spam folder. And if you're using Outlook, check your quarantine folder too – sometimes it ends up there. The email comes from Figr, so you can whitelist us to avoid this next time.

### Step 3: Click the magic link

Open the email. Click the link. You're in.

## Set up your workspace

Before you start designing, you'll want to set up your context. This is where Figr learns about your product.

During onboarding, we'll help you configure:

- **Product Context** – Your flows, screens, and user journeys
- **Design Language** – Your design system, tokens, and components
- **Memories** – Key decisions and constraints that guide every design

This happens on a quick call with our team. We'll walk you through it.

Once you're set up, Figr remembers everything. You never have to explain your product twice.
