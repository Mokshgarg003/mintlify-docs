## Not ready for Figr yet?

<Warning>
  Figr might not be the right fit if:
</Warning>

<Accordion title="You're building your first product">
  If you're still discovering product-market fit and everything changes weekly, you need maximum flexibility. Figr shines when you have some established patterns to build upon.

  **Come back when:** You have paying customers and some UI patterns that work.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You need pixel-perfect brand designs">
  Figr excels at product design—dashboards, workflows, SaaS interfaces. For brand websites, marketing pages, or artistic designs, specialized tools are better.

  **Use Figr for:** Your app. **Use other tools for:** Your marketing site.
</Accordion>

<Accordion title="You're a solo designer on simple projects">
  If you're designing simple sites with no handoff complexity, Figr might be overkill. Our collaboration and production features shine with teams.

  **Consider Figr when:** You start handing off to developers or scaling beyond one designer.
</Accordion>
