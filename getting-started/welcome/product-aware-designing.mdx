# Product-Aware Designing

Generic design AI gives you generic results. Figr creates designs that feel like they've always belonged in your product.

<success>
  The secret: Figr doesn't just know design patterns. It knows **your** product's patterns, constraints, and user behavior.
</success>

## The Context Problem

Most AI design tools work like this:

<Steps>
  <Step title="Describe Your Need">
    "Create a user dashboard for our analytics platform"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Generic Output">
    Beautiful dashboard with generic charts, standard layout, placeholder data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Reality Check">
    Doesn't match your navigation, uses wrong colors, missing key features your users need
  </Step>
  <Step title="Manual Rework">
    Spend hours adapting the generic design to your actual product
  </Step>
</Steps>

**This is backwards.** You shouldn't adapt AI output to your product. AI should adapt to your product.

## How Figr Builds Product Awareness

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Screen Sharing">
    Share your screen and navigate your actual product. Figr watches and learns:

    - Your navigation patterns and hierarchy
    - How forms actually work in your product
    - Where your calls-to-action typically appear
    - What your error states look like
    - How data is typically displayed

    <Frame>
      ![Figr learning from screen sharing session](/images/screen-sharing-learning.png)
    </Frame>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Design System Upload">
    Import your design tokens once. Figr remembers:

    ```json
    {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#6366f1",
        "success": "#10b981",
        "warning": "#f59e0b"
      },
      "spacing": {
        "xs": "4px",
        "sm": "8px", 
        "md": "16px"
      },
      "typography": {
        "heading-1": "32px",
        "body": "16px"
      }
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Research Integration">
    Upload user research, analytics, and personas. Figr designs based on actual user behavior:

    - Heat map data showing attention patterns
    - A/B test results from previous features
    - User interview insights about pain points
    - Conversion funnel data
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Constraint Learning">
    Tell Figr your technical and business constraints once:

    - "We can't use overlays because of our mobile app"
    - "New users must see pricing within 30 seconds"
    - "Enterprise customers need bulk actions on every list"
    - "Our backend can only handle 50 items per page"
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Context in Action

### Before: Generic AI Dashboard

```
Prompt: "Create a user dashboard"
Result: Standard 3-column layout, generic charts, 
        placeholder navigation
```

### After: Product-Aware Dashboard

```
Context: SaaS analytics tool, mobile-first users, 
         complex data hierarchies
Result: Custom visualization matching your data structure,
        navigation that fits your existing app,
        progressive disclosure based on user research
```

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Generic Design" icon="template">
    - Standard layout patterns
    - Placeholder content
    - Generic color schemes
    - One-size-fits-all components
  </Card>
  <Card title="Product-Aware Design" icon="target">
    - Your established patterns
    - Real content structure
    - Your actual design system
    - Components that match your codebase
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

## Memory Across Sessions

<info>
  **Persistent Context:** Unlike other AI tools, Figr remembers everything about your product permanently. Start a new canvas six months later, and Figr still knows your users prefer compact layouts and your enterprise clients need export features.
</info>

### What Gets Remembered

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Product Patterns">
    - How your navigation actually works
    - Where important actions are typically placed
    - Your content hierarchy and information architecture
    - Error handling and feedback patterns
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Behavior">
    - Which layouts convert better
    - Where users typically get stuck
    - What information they look for first
    - How they navigate between features
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Technical Constraints">
    - Component limitations in your codebase
    - Performance requirements
    - Browser support needs
    - Accessibility requirements
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Design Decisions">
    - Why certain patterns were chosen
    - What alternatives were considered
    - Results from A/B tests
    - Feedback from user testing
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Building Your Product Context

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Product Tour">
    Share your screen and give Figr a comprehensive tour of your product. Click through major flows, show different user types, demonstrate edge cases.

    **Time investment:** 15-20 minutes once **Benefit:** Every future design understands your product deeply
  </Step>
  <Step title="Upload Core Assets">
    Import your design system, brand guidelines, user research, and any technical documentation.

    **What to include:**

    - Design tokens (colors, typography, spacing)
    - Component library or style guide
    - User personas and research findings
    - Analytics and conversion data
  </Step>
  <Step title="Define Constraints">
    Tell Figr about your technical limitations, business requirements, and user needs.

    **Examples:**

    - "Mobile users are 70% of our traffic"
    - "Enterprise features need approval workflows"
    - "Page load times must stay under 2 seconds"
  </Step>
  <Step title="Iterate and Refine">
    As Figr creates designs, provide feedback about what works and what doesn't. This builds even deeper product understanding.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## The Compound Effect

The more Figr knows about your product, the better every design becomes:

<Frame>
  ![Graph showing how design quality improves with more product context](/images/context-improvement-graph.png)
</Frame>

**Week 1:** Designs need significant modification to fit your product **Month 1:** Designs require minor adjustments\
**Month 3:** Designs ship with minimal changes **Month 6:** Figr anticipates needs you haven't even articulated

<tip>
  **Pro tip:** The initial context-building session is the best investment you'll make. Spend 30 minutes showing Figr your product thoroughly, and save hours on every future design project.
