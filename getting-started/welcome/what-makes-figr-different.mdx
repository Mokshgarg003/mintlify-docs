## The problem with current AI design tools

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="What Others Do">
    - Generate isolated screens from text prompts
    - Create generic templates that look the same
    - Output designs that need 50% rework
    - Forget your product context after each session
    - Skip the fundamentals and jump to pixels
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="What Figr Does">
    - Understands your entire product ecosystem
    - Creates production-ready designs with your components
    - Shows reasoning backed by successful app patterns
    - Remembers everything permanently across sessions
    - Preserves design process: research → wireframes → high-fidelity
  </Tab>
