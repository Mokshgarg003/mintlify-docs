# What Makes Figr Different

Most design tools treat AI like a fancy autocomplete. Figr treats AI like your most experienced product designer who's worked on your exact product for years.

<info>
  Figr doesn't just generate designs. It understands your product, remembers your constraints, and creates interfaces that actually ship.
</info>

## Product-Aware Designing

Traditional design tools start from scratch every time. You explain your product, upload assets, describe user flows, and hope the AI understands your context.

**Figr learns your product once, remembers forever.**

- Upload your product specs → Figr knows your user personas
- Share your screen showing the app → Figr understands your navigation patterns
- Import your design tokens → Figr uses your actual color palette
- Connect your analytics → Figr knows which flows convert

## Memory That Actually Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional AI" icon="brain">
    Forgets everything between sessions. Explains the same constraints repeatedly. Generates generic components.
  </Card>
  <Card title="Figr's Memory" icon="database">
    Remembers your design system, user research, product constraints, and past decisions permanently across all projects.
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### What Figr Remembers

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Design System & Components">
    Your color tokens, typography scales, spacing systems, and component library. Once uploaded, Figr uses your actual design system in every new design.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Product Context">
    User personas, business goals, technical constraints, and product roadmap. Figr designs with your specific context, not generic best practices.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="User Behavior Data">
    Analytics, heatmaps, user research findings. Figr prioritizes design decisions based on actual user behavior in your product.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Past Design Decisions">
    Why certain patterns were chosen, what variations were tested, and which solutions worked. Figr builds on successful patterns instead of repeating experiments.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Production-Ready Output

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Component-Mapped">
    Figr exports designs using your actual React components, not generic divs. Your engineers recognize the code immediately.

    ```jsx
    <Button variant="primary" size="large">
      Get Started
    </Button>
    ```

    Not random CSS:

    ```css
    .button-1234 {
      background: #0066cc;
      padding: 12px 24px;
      /* ... */
    }
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Design Token Mapped">
    Uses your actual design tokens:

    ```jsx
    color: $color-primary-600
    spacing: $spacing-lg
    typography: $text-heading-sm
    ```

    Instead of hardcoded values:

    ```css
    color: #1a73e8;
    margin: 24px;
    font-size: 18px;
    ```
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Accessible by Default">
    Every design includes proper semantic HTML, ARIA labels, and meets WCAG guidelines because Figr learned from your existing accessible patterns.
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Figr Thinks About Design

Traditional design AI: "Generate a login form" **Figr:** "Generate a login form for a B2B SaaS product with enterprise SSO requirements, that matches the navigation pattern from the dashboard you showed me, uses the error handling approach from your checkout flow, and follows the progressive disclosure principle from your user research findings."

<Steps>
  <Step title="Understands Your Product">
    Figr analyzes your current product, design system, user research, and business context to build a comprehensive understanding.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Applies Your Context">
    Every design decision references your specific constraints, user needs, and product goals rather than generic design patterns.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Creates Production-Ready Designs">
    Outputs use your actual components and design tokens, making the engineer handoff seamless.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Learns and Improves">
    Figr remembers what works in your product and applies those insights to future designs, building institutional knowledge.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Real Product Understanding

<tip>
  **The Screen Share Difference:** Show Figr your actual product once. It learns your information architecture, interaction patterns, error states, and user flows. No PRD required.
</tip>

When you share your screen and click through your product, Figr notices:

- How your navigation actually works (not how you think it works)
- Where users get confused (from your analytics)
- Which patterns you've already established
- What edge cases exist in your flows

This means Figr designs **with** your product, not **for** your product.
