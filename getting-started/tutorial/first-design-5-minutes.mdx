# First Design in 5 Minutes

See the magic of product-aware designing. We'll create a real interface for your product that uses your actual design system and understands your user context.

<Callout type="tip">
**What makes this different:** Instead of generic templates, you'll get a design that feels like it belongs in your existing product from day one.
</Callout>

## Before We Start

**Quick checklist:**
- ✅ Figr account created and project set up
- ✅ Basic product context provided (even minimal is fine)
- ✅ 5 minutes of uninterrupted time

<Callout type="info">
**New to Figr?** This tutorial works even if you haven't uploaded design systems or extensive context yet. Figr will use what you've provided and show you how it gets better with more information.
</Callout>

## Choose Your Design Challenge

Pick a design that would be useful for your actual product:

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="New Feature Page">
    **Perfect for:** Adding something new to existing product
    
    **Examples:**
    - User settings page
    - Analytics dashboard section
    - Team management interface
    - Notification preferences
    
    **Why this works:** Figr can reference your existing patterns
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Improved User Flow">
    **Perfect for:** Optimizing existing experiences
    
    **Examples:**
    - Better onboarding flow
    - Streamlined checkout process
    - Enhanced search results
    - Simplified admin panel
    
    **Why this works:** Figr understands current pain points
  </Tab>
  
  <Tab title="Mobile Adaptation">
    **Perfect for:** Cross-platform consistency
    
    **Examples:**
    - Mobile version of desktop feature
    - Responsive dashboard layout
    - Touch-optimized controls
    - Progressive web app interface
    
    **Why this works:** Figr adapts your patterns to new contexts
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Step-by-Step Design Creation

<Steps>
  <Step title="Start with Context">
    Open your Figr project and click **"New Design"**
    
    **Instead of starting with a blank canvas, describe your specific need:**
    
    ```
    Good prompt: "Create a user profile settings page for our 
    B2B analytics platform where marketing managers can update 
    their notification preferences and team access permissions"
    
    Generic prompt: "Create a settings page"
    ```
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/new-design-prompt.png" alt="Figr interface showing design prompt input with context-rich example" />
    </Frame>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Watch Figr Think">
    Figr analyzes your request against your product context:
    
    <CardGroup cols={2}>
      <Card title="Context Analysis" icon="brain">
        - Reviews your uploaded product information
        - Checks your design system assets
        - Considers user research insights
        - Applies technical constraints
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="Pattern Recognition" icon="search">
        - Identifies relevant existing patterns
        - Finds similar interfaces in your product
        - Selects appropriate components
        - Determines optimal layout approach
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
    
    **This takes 15-30 seconds** - much faster than traditional design tools
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Review Initial Design">
    Figr presents your design with context-aware reasoning:
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/initial-design-result.png" alt="Generated design with explanatory sidebar showing reasoning" />
    </Frame>
    
    **What to look for:**
    - Does it use your actual colors/fonts?
    - Does the layout feel familiar to your product?
    - Are the components similar to existing ones?
    - Does the information hierarchy make sense?
    
    <Callout type="success">
    **It should feel surprisingly "right"** even on the first try. That's the power of product-aware design.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Make Targeted Improvements">
    **Instead of starting over, refine specifically:**
    
    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Content Adjustments">
        "Move the save button to the top right to match our other admin pages"
        
        "Add a bulk edit option since enterprise users often manage 50+ team members"
        
        "Include the user's current plan type like we show in the billing section"
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Visual Refinements">
        "Use our $color-success-600 for the save button instead of generic green"
        
        "Make the section headers match the typography from our dashboard"
        
        "Add the subtle border style we use in other form sections"
      </Tab>
      
      <Tab title="Functional Enhancements">
        "Add inline validation like our signup form"
        
        "Include the confirmation dialog pattern from our delete actions"
        
        "Show loading states consistent with our other async operations"
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Export and Share">
    **Get production-ready assets:**
    
    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="For Developers" icon="code">
        - Component-mapped React/Vue code
        - CSS with your actual design tokens  
        - Responsive breakpoints included
        - Accessibility attributes added
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="For Designers" icon="palette">
        - High-resolution PNG/SVG exports
        - Figma-compatible file export
        - Layer-organized design file
        - Annotation with specifications
      </Card>
      
      <Card title="For Stakeholders" icon="presentation">
        - Interactive prototype link
        - PDF with design rationale
        - Before/after comparisons
        - Implementation timeline estimate
      </Card>
