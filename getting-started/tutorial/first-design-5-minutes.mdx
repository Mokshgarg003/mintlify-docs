See the magic of product-aware designing. We'll create a real interface for real-world product that uses actual design system and understands user context.

  **What makes this different:** Instead of generic templates, you'll get a design that feels like it belongs in your existing product from day one.

### Watch how Figr builds designs on top of existing product

## What you'll see

This video shows two examples: simplifying Calendly's event setup flow and building a GitHub code review interface. You'll see how Figr understands your product deeply before designing anything.

## 1. Understanding your product

Figr doesn't just generate screens. **It learns your product first.**

### What you can share

Drop in anything that helps Figr understand what you're building:

- **Screen recordings** - Show how your product works. Figr watches every frame and listens to your explanation
- **Analytics** - Upload CSVs or screenshots of user behavior, conversion funnels, or feature usage
- **Images** - Screenshots of existing flows, competitor apps, or rough sketches
- **Figma links** - Your current designs, so Figr knows what already exists

### What Figr does with it

It maps user journeys. Spots friction points. Asks clarifying questions before jumping to solutions.

**This is the difference.** Most AI tools skip straight to designs. Figr builds context first.

## 2. Set up your design system

When you have a design system, Figr uses it. Every token, every component, every rule.

### How it works

Figr maps your entire design language:

- Colors, spacing, typography tokens
- Component libraries and their variants
- Usage patterns and constraints

### Getting started

Want to set this up? Email us at [**hi@figr.design**](mailto:hi@figr.design)

We'll help you connect your design system so every output is production-ready from day one.

## 3. Iterate and export to Figma

Figr keeps all your iterations on one canvas. Zoom out to compare. Zoom in to refine.

### Make changes

Click any element to edit. Add components. Adjust layouts. Request variations. You're in control of what gets built and when.

### Take it to Figma

One click exports everything to Figma—layer by layer, properly structured, ready to hand off.

Open the Figr plugin in Figma, paste your design, and you're done.
