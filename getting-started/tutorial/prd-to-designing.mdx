## How it works

You don't need separate tools for thinking and designing. Figr takes you from messy research to shippable screens in one continuous workflow.

Drop your context. Brainstorm together. Build what matters.

Figr doesn't force you to jump to solutions. It helps you understand the problem first, then design from there.

### Start with anything

Upload what you have. **No formatting required.**

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Product data" icon="chart-line">
    Analytics CSVs, user feedback, session recordings
  </Card>
  <Card title="Visual context" icon="image">
    Screenshots, Figma files, competitor apps
  </Card>
  <Card title="Documents" icon="file">
    PDFs, notes, specs, existing PRDs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Live product" icon="display">
    Screen share your app. Figr watches & learns
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

Everything you share builds Figr's understanding of your product. You won't need to explain twice.

<Tip>
  **Screen sharing is powerful.** Show Figr your actual product flows. It'll understand edge cases, states, and constraints that screenshots miss.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Brainstorm and research

Start with a simple prompt. Figr doesn't guess—it explores with you.

```
"We're seeing 40% drop-off in onboarding. Help me understand why and what patterns work."
```

**Figr will:**

- Ask clarifying questions about your users
- Search the web for relevant patterns and research
- Benchmark against apps in your category
- Surface insights from your uploaded data

This isn't generic advice. Figr grounds everything in your specific context and real-world examples.

### Research that actually helps

When Figr searches, it's looking for:

- How top apps solve similar problems
- UX patterns that match your constraints
- Data on what converts vs. what looks nice
- Trade-offs between different approaches

You get citations. You get reasoning. You can validate every suggestion.

## Step 2: Create PRDs and flows

Once you understand the problem, define what you're building.

**Ask Figr to:**

- Draft a PRD from your conversation
- Map out user flows with edge cases
- Define success metrics and KPIs
- Document constraints and requirements

<CodeGroup>

```markdown Example prompt
"Create a PRD for redesigning onboarding based on our conversation. Include metrics we'll track."
```


```markdown Another approach
"Map the happy path and error states for the new checkout flow."
```

</CodeGroup>

Everything lives on your canvas. Compare options side-by-side. Iterate without losing context.

<Note>
  PRDs aren't documents you file away. They're living artifacts that connect directly to your designs. Change the spec, update the screens—it's one continuous workspace.
</Note>

## Step 3: Design the screens

Now you're ready to build UI. **But you're not starting from scratch.**

Figr already knows:

- Your product flows and constraints
- The patterns you're considering
- Your design system (if you've uploaded it)
- The problem you're solving

### Bottom-up design

Figr doesn't jump to final mockups. It helps you think through:

1. **Flows first** — Map the complete journey
2. **Key screens** — Build critical moments
3. **Components** — Design with your actual design system
4. **States** — Empty, loading, error, success
5. **Variations** — A/B options with trade-offs explained

<Steps>
  <Step title="Define the flow">
    Start with user journeys. What are they trying to do? Where can they fail?
  </Step>
  <Step title="Build key screens">
    Focus on moments that matter. Figr generates options grounded in your constraints.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Refine and iterate">
    Click any element to edit. Get reviews. Make micro-improvements without starting over.
  </Step>
</Steps>

### Production-ready outputs

When you're done, your designs are ready to ship:

## Real example: Perplexity research feature

Here's how a team used Figr to design a new academic research mode:

<Frame>
  

  ## **See the full process**

  **1. Context gathering**

  - Uploaded analytics showing search patterns
  - Screen shared existing research flows
  - Shared competitor PDFs (Google Scholar, Semantic Scholar)

  **2. Brainstorming**

  - Figr researched academic research UX patterns
  - Identified key pain points: citation tracking, source credibility, cross-referencing
  - Defined success metrics: depth of research, time to insight

  **3. PRD creation**

  - Documented the feature scope and constraints
  - Mapped user flows for different research types
  - Defined integration points with existing product

  **4. Design exploration**

  - Generated flows for citation management
  - Built variations for source credibility UI
  - Created states for in-progress research

  **5. Refinement**

  - Team reviewed on canvas together
  - Made precise edits to individual components
  - Exported to Figma for handoff

## Why this approach works

**You preserve design fundamentals.** No jumping to solutions before understanding the problem.

**You explore properly.** Generate variations, compare trade-offs, make informed decisions.

**You maintain control.** Edit the plan, adjust the approach, customize outputs at every step.

**You ship faster.** Everything connects—research informs specs, specs inform designs, designs export to code.

## Tips for better results

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Upload your design system early">
    Figr will match your tokens, components, and patterns automatically. Set it once, never think about it again.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Share more context, not less">
    Drop that messy PDF. Paste that Slack thread. Upload those analytics. Figr synthesizes—you don't need to clean up first.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Use screen sharing for complex flows">
    Show don't tell. Figr catches nuances that screenshots miss—micro-interactions, state transitions, error handling.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Compare options side-by-side">
    Everything lives on one infinite canvas. Zoom out to see all variations at once. Make decisions faster.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Get reviews before building">
    Use Figr's review feature for actionable feedback grounded in real patterns—not generic AI suggestions.
  </Accordion>

## What you can build

This workflow works for:

- **Complete features** — From research to shipped designs
- **Redesigns** — Improve existing flows with data backing
- **New products** — 0→1 design with proper foundations
- **A/B tests** — Generate variants with clear trade-offs
- **Design systems** — Document and apply patterns consistently

<Card title="Ready to start?" icon="rocket" href="https://app.figr.design/">
  Open a canvas and drop in your context. Figr will guide you from there.

## Common questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Do I need a complete PRD to start designing?">
    No. Start with what you know. Figr helps you fill in the gaps through conversation. You can create the PRD and designs together.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Figr if I don't have a design system?">
    Yes. Figr can work with basic tokens (colors, typography) or generate designs using common patterns. You can formalize your system over time.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Figr handle edge cases and error states?">
    Explicitly. When you're mapping flows or building screens, Figr prompts you to define empty states, loading states, errors, and permissions. It doesn't skip the messy stuff.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple people work on the same canvas?">
    Yes. Share links, set permissions, co-edit live. Everyone sees updates in real-time. Leave comments, suggest changes, stay aligned.
