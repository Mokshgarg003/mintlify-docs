# PRD to Design Workflow

See how product teams go from product requirements document to shipped feature using Figr's end-to-end workflow. This is where Figr's product-aware intelligence really shines.

<info>
  **Real workflow:** This tutorial follows an actual feature development cycle - from initial requirements through design, review, and developer handoff.
</info>

## The Challenge: New Feature Development

**Scenario:** Your B2B SaaS product needs a new team collaboration feature. You have:

- üìÑ Product requirements document
- üìä User research data
- üé® Existing design system
- ‚ö° 2-week development sprint

**Goal:** Production-ready designs that developers can implement immediately.

## Phase 1: Import and Context Building

<Steps>
  <Step title="Upload the PRD">
    **Start by giving Figr the complete context:**

    <Frame>
      ![Figr interface showing PRD upload with document preview](/images/prd-upload.png)
    </Frame>
    **Supported formats:**

    - PDF documents
    - Google Docs links
    - Notion pages
    - Markdown files
    - Word documents

    **What Figr extracts:**

    - User stories and acceptance criteria
    - Technical constraints and requirements
    - Success metrics and KPIs
    - Timeline and priority information
  </Step>
  <Step title="Add Supporting Research">
    **Upload complementary materials:**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="User Research">
        ```
        ‚úÖ User interview transcripts
        ‚úÖ Survey results and analytics
        ‚úÖ Persona documentation
        ‚úÖ Journey maps and pain points
        ‚úÖ Competitive analysis findings
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Technical Context">
        ```
        ‚úÖ API documentation
        ‚úÖ Database schema relevant to feature
        ‚úÖ Performance requirements

        ‚úÖ Go-to-market timeline
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Link to Existing Product">
    **Show Figr how this feature fits:**

    **Screen sharing session (5 minutes):**

    - Navigate to related areas in your current product
    - Show where the new feature will be accessed
    - Demonstrate similar workflows already in place
    - Highlight any integration points

    **Alternative: Upload screenshots with annotations**
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 2: Collaborative Ideation

<tip>
  **Multi-perspective planning:** Figr helps PMs, designers, and engineers collaborate on feature exploration before diving into detailed design.
</tip>

<Tabs>
  <Tab title="Information Architecture">
    **Start with structure:**

    "Based on our PRD for the team collaboration feature, create an information architecture diagram showing how this fits into our existing navigation and what new sections we'll need."

    <Frame>
      ![Information architecture diagram generated by Figr showing new feature integration](/images/ia-diagram.png)
    </Frame>
    **Figr considers:**

    - Your existing navigation patterns
    - User mental models from research
    - Technical constraints from PRD
    - Integration points with current features
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="User Flow Mapping">
    **Map the complete journey:**

    "Create user flow diagrams for the three main collaboration scenarios outlined in our PRD: team setup, project collaboration, and progress tracking."

    **What Figr includes:**

    - Entry points from existing product areas
    - Decision points based on user research
    - Error states and edge cases
    - Success metrics touchpoints

    </CardGroup>
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Wireframe Exploration">
    **Test concepts quickly:**

    "Generate low-fidelity wireframes for the main collaboration dashboard based on our PRD requirements and existing product patterns."

    **Benefits of Figr wireframes:**

    - Use your actual content structure
    - Respect your layout conventions
    - Include realistic data scenarios
    - Consider mobile responsiveness from start
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## Phase 3: Detailed Interface Design

<Steps>
  <Step title="Generate Core Interfaces">
    **Create production-ready designs:**

    ```
    Prompt: "Design the team collaboration dashboard for our B2B 
    platform. Include the project overview cards, team member 
    management, and real-time activity feed as specified in our 
    PRD. Use our existing design system and match the navigation 
    pattern from our main dashboard."
    ```

    <Frame>
      ![High-fidelity dashboard design showing team collaboration features](/images/collaboration-dashboard.png)
    </Frame>
    **Figr automatically includes:**

    - Your actual color palette and typography
    - Consistent component usage
    - Responsive layout considerations
    - Accessibility compliance
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design System Integration">
    **Ensure consistency:**

    <AccordionGroup>
      <Accordion title="Component Reuse">
        Figr identifies existing components that can be used:

        - "Using your existing card component for project overviews"
        - "Adapting your button styles for collaboration actions"
        - "Applying your form patterns to team member invitations"
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="New Component Needs">
        Figr suggests new components required:

        - "Activity feed item - new component needed"
        - "Team member avatar group - variation of existing avatar"
        - "Real-time status indicator - new micro-component"
      </Accordion>
      <Accordion title="Design Token Usage">
        Automatic application of your design tokens:

        ```css
        color: $color-primary-600
        spacing: $spacing-lg  
        typography: $text-heading-md
        shadow: $shadow-elevation-2
        ```
      </Accordion>
    </AccordionGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="Responsive Variations">
    **Cross-device consistency:**

    "Create mobile and tablet versions of the collaboration dashboard that maintain functionality while adapting to smaller screens."

    <CardGroup cols={3}>
      <Card title="Desktop" icon="desktop">
        Full feature set with optimal layout for large screens
      </Card>
      <Card title="Tablet" icon="tablet">
        Adapted layout with touch-optimized controls
      </Card>
      <Card title="Mobile" icon="mobile">
        Progressive disclosure with core features prioritized
      </Card>
    </CardGroup>
  </Step>
  <Step title="State Variations">
    **Complete interaction design:**

    <Tabs>
      <Tab title="Loading States">
        ```
        - Dashboard loading with skeleton components
        - Individual card loading states  
        - Progressive loading for activity feed
        - Real-time update animations
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Empty States">
        ```
        - New team with no projects yet
        - No recent activity to display
        - Search results with no matches
        - Error states with recovery actions
        ```
      </Tab>
      <Tab title="Success States">
        ```
        - Team member successfully added
        - Project collaboration initiated
        - Activity feed updated in real-time
        - Notification confirmations
        ```
      </Tab>
    </Tabs>
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Phase 4: Team Review and Iteration

<success>
  **Collaborative refinement:** Multiple team members can contribute simultaneously, building on each other's expertise.
</success>

<Steps>
  <Step title="Stakeholder Review">
    **Share with decision makers:**

    <Frame>
      ![Design interface showing stakeholder comments and feedback](/images/stakeholder-comments.png)
    </Frame>
    **Review workflow:**

    1. Generate shareable link with appropriate permissions
    2. Stakeholders leave contextual comments
    3. Designer addresses feedback with targeted refinements
    4. Automatic notification when updates are made
  </Step>
  <Step title="Engineering Feasibility">
    **Technical validation:**

    **Engineer feedback examples:**

    ```
    ‚úÖ "Real-time activity feed looks good - we can use WebSockets"
    ‚ö†Ô∏è "Team member search might be slow with 1000+ users"
    ‚ùå "Drag-and-drop project reordering not possible in current sprint"
    ```

    **Figr helps with alternatives:**

    - Automatic performance impact estimates
    - Component complexity indicators
    - Implementation time projections
    - Alternative interaction patterns
  </Step>
  <Step title="Design Iteration">
    **Targeted improvements:**

    Instead of redesigning from scratch:

    ```
    "Update the team member search to use our existing global 
    search pattern and add pagination for performance"
    
    "Replace drag-and-drop with the priority selection dropdown 
    we use in other admin interfaces"
    ```
  </Step>
</Steps>
