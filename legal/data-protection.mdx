## Your data belongs to you

**Simple as that.**

Everything you create in Figr—your designs, product context, user flows—it's all yours. We don't sell it. We don't train our AI models on your proprietary designs to make someone else's experience better.

Your competitive edge stays yours.

<Info>
  **Security first:** Every aspect of Figr is designed with data protection in mind, from our infrastructure architecture to our development practices and employee training.
</Info>

## What we don't do with your data

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="We don't train on your designs">
    Your proprietary designs never become training data for models serving other customers. **Model isolation is strict.** What you build in Figr stays in your account.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="We don't sell your data">
    Never have. Never will. Your customer information, analytics, design systems—none of it gets sold to third parties.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="We don't share designs across accounts">
    Generated designs remain private to your workspace. Other Figr users can't see what you're building. AI interactions are logged only for your audit trail.
  </Accordion>

## How we protect your data

### Encryption everywhere

All your data is encrypted both in transit and at rest. We use **AES-256 encryption** for storage and **TLS/HSTS** for everything moving between you and our servers.

No exceptions.

### Access controls that actually work

Only team members who absolutely need access get it. And even then:

- Multi-factor authentication (MFA) required
- Every access is logged and monitored
- Least privilege principle enforced
- Automated revocation when someone leaves

### You control everything

You decide who sees what. You can:

- Set granular permissions across your org
- Export your data anytime
- Delete it whenever you want
- Track every change through audit logs
