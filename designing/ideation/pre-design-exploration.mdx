# Pre-Design Exploration

Bridge the gap between requirements and design execution. Use Figr's exploration tools to validate concepts, test assumptions, and establish design direction before detailed interface work.

<tip>
  **Design with confidence:** Validate core concepts and user flows before investing time in detailed visual design and component creation.
