# Links & Notes

Enhance Figr's product understanding with contextual links and detailed notes. Share references, document decisions, and provide ongoing guidance that shapes every design.

<info>
  **Contextual intelligence:** Links and notes create a rich knowledge base that Figr references when making design decisions, ensuring consistency and context-awareness.
