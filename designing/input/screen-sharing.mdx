# Screen Sharing

Screen sharing is Figr's most powerful context-building feature. Show Figr your actual product in action to build comprehensive understanding that no document or screenshot can match.

<Callout type="tip">
**The game changer:** 15 minutes of screen sharing teaches Figr more about your product than hours of documentation. It sees how things actually work, not just how they're supposed to work.
</Callout>

## Why Screen Sharing Works

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Static Context" icon="image">
    **Screenshots and docs show:**
    - How interfaces look
    - Individual page states
    - Design system components
    - Documented workflows
    
    **Missing:** Flow, interaction, real usage patterns
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Live Context" icon="video">
    **Screen sharing reveals:**
    - How users actually navigate
    - Real interaction patterns
    - Edge cases and error states
    - Performance and loading behavior
    
    **Result:** Complete product understanding

## Screen Sharing Setup

<Steps>
  <Step title="Prepare Your Demo">
    **Before starting the session:**
    
    ```yaml
    Environment Setup:
    ✅ Use staging or demo environment
    ✅ Prepare realistic test data
    ✅ Close sensitive tabs/applications
    ✅ Test screen sharing permissions
    ✅ Plan 3-4 key user flows to demonstrate
    ```
    
    <Callout type="warning">
    **Privacy first:** Only share demo environments with test data. Figr doesn't record sessions, but practice good security hygiene.
    </Callout>
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Start Screen Sharing">
    **Initiate from Figr project:**
    
    <Frame>
      <img src="/images/screen-share-start.png" alt="Figr interface showing screen sharing initiation button and setup options" />
    </Frame>
    
    **Sharing options:**
    - **Entire screen:** Best for comprehensive demos
    - **Application window:** Focus on specific app
    - **Browser tab:** Web application demos
    - **Mobile device:** Via USB debugging or simulator

## Effective Screen Sharing Techniques

<Steps>
  <Step title="Narrate Your Actions">
    **Provide context as you navigate:**
    
    ```
    Good narration:
    "I'm clicking on Projects because that's where users 
    typically start their workflow. Notice how the sidebar 
    stays collapsed on tablet sizes..."
    
    "This error message appears because we validate email 
    addresses in real-time. Users often miss this if 
    they're typing quickly..."
    
    "The dashboard loads slowly with lots of data, so we 
    show these skeleton components to maintain the illusion 
    of speed..."
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Show Multiple User Types">
    **Demonstrate different perspectives:**
    
    <Tabs>

        - Analytics and reporting views
        ```
