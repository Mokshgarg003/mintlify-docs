# How Global Memory Works

Figr's memory system is what makes product-aware design possible. Unlike other AI tools that forget everything between sessions, Figr builds a permanent understanding of your product, team, and users.

<success>
  **The game changer:** Upload your design system once, explain your constraints once, show your product once. Figr remembers forever and applies this knowledge to every new design.
</success>

## What Makes Figr's Memory Different

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional AI Tools" icon="refresh">
    **Session-based memory:**

    - Forgets everything when you close the tool
    - Requires re-explaining context every time
    - Can't build on previous design decisions
    - Generic outputs that ignore your product reality

    **Result:** Constant repetition and generic designs
  </Card>
  <Card title="Figr's Global Memory" icon="database">
    **Persistent product understanding:**

    - Remembers context permanently across sessions
    - Builds cumulative knowledge over time
    - References past decisions and learnings
    - Creates increasingly accurate designs

    **Result:** Designs that improve and feel more native over time

    **What Figr learns from your product usage:**

    <Frame>
      ![Diagram showing how Figr learns from user interactions and builds experience](/images/memory-experience-layer.png)
    </Frame>
    **Continuous learning sources:**

    - Screen sharing sessions that show actual user behavior
    - Design feedback and iteration patterns
    - A/B test results and performance data
    - User research findings and usability studies
    - Analytics data about feature usage and conversion
  </Tab>
  <Tab title="Decision Layer">
    **How Figr remembers design reasoning:**

    ```
    Design Decision: "Use inline validation for forms"
    Reasoning: "User research shows 23% better completion rates"
    Context: "Applied to signup, checkout, and profile editing"
    Results: "Reduced support tickets by 31%"
    
    Future Application: Figr automatically suggests inline 
    validation for new forms based on this proven success.
    ```

    **Pattern recognition:**

    - What design solutions work for your specific users
    - Which interaction patterns reduce friction
    - How different user types prefer different approaches
    - When to break conventions vs. follow them
  </Tab>
</Tabs>

## How Memory Builds Over Time

<Steps>
  <Step title="Initial Setup">
    **Day 1: Foundation building**

    When you first set up Figr:

    - Upload design system assets
    - Share your screen to show product
    - Provide user research and context
    - Define technical and business constraints

    **Memory strength:** 60% - Good foundation
  </Step>
  <Step title="Early Usage">
    **Weeks 1-2: Pattern recognition**

    As you create designs and provide feedback:

    - Figr learns your design preferences
    - Understands which suggestions you accept/reject
    - Builds patterns from your specific use cases
    - Refines understanding of your user needs

    **Memory strength:** 80% - Strong context awareness
  </Step>
  <Step title="Deep Integration">
    **Month 1+: Institutional knowledge**

    With continued use and team collaboration:

    - Comprehensive understanding of your product ecosystem
    - Nuanced grasp of edge cases and exceptions
    - Predictive insights about user needs
    - Anticipation of design requirements

    **Memory strength:** 95% - Near-human product understanding
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Memory in Action: Real Examples

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="SaaS Dashboard Design">
    **Memory Context:**

    - Product: B2B analytics platform
    - Users: Marketing managers (non-technical)
    - Key insight: Users need quick scanning, not deep analysis

    **Month 1 Design:** Standard dashboard with detailed charts
    **Month 6 Design:** Scannable cards with key metrics highlighted, drill-down on demand

    **Why the difference:** Figr learned that users prefer overview → detail pattern from usage analytics and user feedback
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="E-commerce Mobile Flow">
    **Memory Context:**

    - Product: Fashion e-commerce app
    - Users: Mobile-first, visual browsers
    - Key insight: Purchase decisions driven by social proof

    **Initial Design:** Product page with standard description
    **Evolved Design:** Social proof prominent (reviews, photos), purchase path streamlined

    **Learning source:** User session recordings showing how customers actually browse and buy
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Enterprise Admin Panel">
    **Memory Context:**

    - Product: HR management system
    - Users: HR administrators (expert users)
    - Key insight: Efficiency over simplicity

    **Early Design:** Simplified interface with guided workflows
    **Mature Design:** Information-dense layout with keyboard shortcuts and bulk actions

    **Memory evolution:** Learned that expert users value speed over hand-holding
