# Automatic Matching

Figr's pattern recognition ensures design consistency without manual effort. Learn how automatic matching works and how to leverage it for better design systems.

<Callout type="tip">
**Effortless consistency:** Figr automatically identifies your design patterns and applies them consistently, while suggesting improvements to strengthen your design system.
</Callout>

## How Automatic Matching Works

<Steps>
  <Step title="Pattern Recognition">
    **Figr analyzes your existing designs:**

    </Frame>
    
    **Analysis capabilities:**
    ```yaml
    Visual pattern detection:
    - Color usage frequency and combinations
    - Typography hierarchies and relationships
    - Spacing patterns and rhythms
    - Component shapes and styling
    - Layout structures and grids
    
    Interaction pattern recognition:
    - Button behaviors and states
    - Form validation approaches
    - Navigation interaction models
    - Hover and focus effects
    - Animation and transition styles
    ```
