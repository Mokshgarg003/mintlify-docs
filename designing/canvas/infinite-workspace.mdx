# Infinite Workspace

Figr's infinite canvas gives you unlimited space to explore, iterate, and collaborate. Unlike traditional design tools with fixed artboards, Figr adapts to how you actually think and work.

<Callout type="success">
**Think without limits:** No more cramped artboards or rigid layouts. Spread out your ideas, compare alternatives, and let your design process flow naturally.
</Callout>

## Canvas Philosophy

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Traditional Tools" icon="grid-3x3">
    **Fixed artboard constraints:**
    - Pre-defined canvas sizes
    - Linear design progression
    - Limited comparison space
    - Rigid organization structure
    
    **Result:** Design thinking constrained by tool limitations
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Figr's Infinite Canvas" icon="maximize">
    **Limitless creative space:**
    - Infinite zoom and pan
    - Organic layout organization
    - Natural comparison workflows
    - Flexible spatial relationships
    
    **Result:** Design thinking drives tool usage, not vice versa
