# Organizing Iterations

Design is iterative by nature. Figr helps you organize design evolution clearly, making it easy to track progress, compare alternatives, and maintain design history.

<Callout type="tip">
**Design evolution made visible:** See your design journey from concept to completion, understand what worked, and build on successful patterns.

## Best Practices for Iteration Organization

<Steps>
  <Step title="Clear Naming Conventions">
    **Consistent iteration labeling:**
    
    ```
    ‚úÖ Good naming:
    "Dashboard v2.1 - Mobile responsive"
    "Checkout flow - Post user testing"
    "Navigation - Accessibility improvements"
    
    ‚ùå Avoid vague names:
    "Design 1", "Latest version", "Final final"
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Strategic Iteration Points">
    **Plan meaningful checkpoints:**
    
    ```yaml
    Natural iteration triggers:
    - After user research sessions
    - Before stakeholder presentations
    - Following technical feasibility reviews
    - Post-accessibility audits
    - After A/B test results
    ```
  </Step>
  
  <Step title="Archive Management">
    **Keep workspace organized:**
    
    ```yaml
    Organization strategy:
    - Active iterations: Central workspace
    - Recent versions: Nearby reference
    - Archived concepts: Separate area
    - Rejected ideas: Documented but hidden
    - Final approved: Clearly marked
    ```
  </Step>
