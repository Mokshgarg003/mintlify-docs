2. Click **Edit** (purple button, bottom-right)
3. Make changes directly in the document
4. Click **Save changes** to apply

### What to Edit

- Correct any inaccuracies from research
- Add internal context not on your website
- Emphasize specific user segments
- Include recent product updates
- Add competitive positioning details

### Add What's Missing

Your website doesn't tell the full story. Add internal context.

- Specific user personas and pain points
- Internal product priorities
- Upcoming features or roadmap
- Constraints and technical requirements
- Brand voice and tone guidelines

## Why Product Knowledge Matters

Design doesn't happen in a vacuum. Your product serves specific users, solves specific problems, operates in a specific market. Generic AI ignores all of this. Figr designs with your business context.

When Figr knows your company mission, target audience, and product positioning, it makes smarter decisions. Not just visually correct designs, but strategically aligned ones.

| **With Product Knowledge**                | **Without Product Knowledge**              |
| ----------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------ |
| Designs that look fine but miss the point | Designs aligned with your product strategy |
| Generic copy and placeholder content      | Content that reflects your audience        |
| No understanding of your users or market  | Decisions informed by your market position |
| Decisions made in isolation               | Context that compounds over time           |
