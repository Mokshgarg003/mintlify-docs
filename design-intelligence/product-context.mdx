## Why Product Knowledge Matters

Design doesn't happen in a vacuum. Your product serves specific users, solves specific problems, operates in a specific market. Generic AI ignores all of this.

**Figr designs with your business context.**

When Figr knows your company mission, target audience, and product positioning, it makes smarter decisions. Not just visually correct designs, but strategically aligned ones.

### Without Product Knowledge

- Designs that look fine but miss the point
- Generic copy and placeholder content
- No understanding of your users or market
- Decisions made in isolation

### With Product Knowledge

- Designs aligned with your product strategy
- Content that reflects your audience
- Decisions informed by your market position
- Context that compounds over time
