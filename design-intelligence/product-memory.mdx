## How Memory Works

Figr listens to your conversations and extracts meaningful context. When you describe how your navigation works, explain a design decision, or share your content style, Figr stores it.

<Accordion title="What triggers memory creation">
  - Describing your product structure
  - Explaining design decisions and rationale
  - Sharing user flow patterns
  - Discussing content and copy style
  - Stating preferences and constraints
</Accordion>

<Tip>
  Memory builds passively. You don't need to do anything special. Just work with Figr, and it learns.
</Tip>

2. Click **Delete** (bottom-left, red text)
3. Confirm deletion

## Why Memory Matters

Every other AI tool has amnesia. You explain your product, describe your patterns, share your constraints. Get a decent result. Tomorrow? Start over. Figr remembers everything.

Your design patterns. Your user flows. Your content style. That decision you made three months ago about button placement. The way you like tables structured. All of it compounds into deeper product understanding over time.

| **Traditional AI Tools**                                 | **Figr's Memory**                                          |
| -------------------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| Forget everything between sessions                       | Learns from every conversation automatically               |
| Require re-explaining context every time                 | Builds deeper understanding over time                      |
| Generate generic outputs that miss your product's nuance | Generates designs that match your existing product         |
| Can't learn from past decisions or feedback              | Remembers decisions, patterns, and preferences permanently |

## Adding Memories Manually

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Ask Figr to Remember">
    In any conversation, explicitly ask Figr to store something.

    ```
    Example prompts:
    
    "Remember that we always use inline validation 
    for forms, never on-submit validation"
    
    "Remember that our primary user persona is a 
    marketing manager at a mid-size B2B company"
    
    "Remember that modals are only used for 
    destructive actions, never for forms"
    
    "Remember that our brand voice is friendly 
    but professional, never casual"
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Be Specific">
    Vague memories aren't useful. Specific ones are.

    | **Less useful**             | **More useful**                                                                                                                                                               |
    | --------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
    | "Remember our button style" | "Remember that primary buttons are solid with   #6366f1 background, secondary buttons are outline   style, and destructive buttons use red background"                        |
    | "Remember how forms work"   | "Remember that forms use inline validation on blur,   error messages appear below the field in red, and   submit button stays disabled until all required   fields are valid" |
  </Accordion>
