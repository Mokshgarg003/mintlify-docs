## How Memory Works

Figr listens to your conversations and extracts meaningful context. When you describe how your navigation works, explain a design decision, or share your content style, Figr stores it.

```
What triggers memory creation:
- Describing your product structure
- Explaining design decisions and rationale
- Sharing user flow patterns
- Discussing content and copy style
- Stating preferences and constraints
```

Memory builds passively. You don't need to do anything special. Just work with Figr, and it learns.

### Delete a Memory

When context becomes outdated or incorrect:

1. Double-click the memory to open it
2. Click **Delete** (bottom-left, red text)
3. Confirm deletion

```
When to delete:
- Product has changed significantly
- Information is now incorrect
- Duplicate or redundant memories
- Deprecated features or patterns
```

## Why Memory Matters

Every other AI tool has amnesia. You explain your product, describe your patterns, share your constraints. Get a decent result. Tomorrow? Start over.

**Figr remembers everything.**

Your design patterns. Your user flows. Your content style. That decision you made three months ago about button placement. The way you like tables structured. All of it compounds into deeper product understanding over time.

### Traditional AI Tools

- Forget everything between sessions
- Require re-explaining context every time
- Generate generic outputs that miss your product's nuance
- Can't learn from past decisions or feedback

### Figr's Memory

- Learns from every conversation automatically
- Builds deeper understanding over time
- Generates designs that match your existing product
- Remembers decisions, patterns, and preferences permanently

## Memory Categories

### Product Context

The foundational details about what you're building.

```
Examples:
- "Dashboard is the entry point after login, 
   shows key metrics and recent activity"
- "User types include Admin, Manager, and Viewer 
   with different permission levels"
- "Primary navigation is a left sidebar that 
   collapses on mobile"
```

### Design Patterns

How your product looks and behaves visually.

```
Examples:
- "Primary CTA uses solid blue/purple button 
   with icon, positioned top-right"
- "Delete actions use red color to signal 
   destructive intent"
- "Disabled states shown in gray text"
- "Cards use subtle shadow with 8px radius"
```

### Flow Patterns

How users move through your product.

```
Examples:
- "Manage Members screen is entry point for 
   organization-level member and seat management"
- "Reducing seats flow: click 'Manage plan seats' 
   → view allocation → select reduction → confirm 
   → handle member removal if necessary"
- "Onboarding uses progressive disclosure across 
   4 steps with skip option on non-critical steps"
```

### Work Style

How you prefer to work with Figr.

```
Examples:
- "Prefers seeing 2-3 variations before committing 
   to a direction"
- "Wants edge cases called out proactively"
- "Likes detailed rationale with design decisions"
- "Prefers mobile-first approach for new features"
```

### Content Patterns

Your voice, tone, and copy conventions.

```
Examples:
- "Error messages are friendly, never blame the user"
- "CTAs use action verbs: 'Create project' not 
   'New project'"
- "Empty states include illustration and single 
   clear action"
- "Microcopy is concise, max 2 lines"
```

## Adding Memories Manually

### Ask Figr to Remember

In any conversation, explicitly ask Figr to store something.

```
Example prompts:

"Remember that we always use inline validation 
for forms, never on-submit validation"

"Remember that our primary user persona is a 
marketing manager at a mid-size B2B company"

"Remember that modals are only used for 
destructive actions, never for forms"

"Remember that our brand voice is friendly 
but professional, never casual"
```

### Be Specific

Vague memories aren't useful. Specific ones are.

```
Less useful:
"Remember our button style"

More useful:
"Remember that primary buttons are solid with 
#6366f1 background, secondary buttons are outline 
style, and destructive buttons use red background"
```

```
Less useful:
"Remember how forms work"

More useful:
"Remember that forms use inline validation on blur, 
error messages appear below the field in red, and 
submit button stays disabled until all required 
fields are valid"
```

## Memory in Action

### Without Memory

```
Your prompt:
"Design a settings page"

Generic AI response:
A settings page that looks like every other 
settings page. Wrong colors. Wrong patterns. 
Wrong component styles. You spend an hour fixing it.
```

### With Memory

```
Your prompt:
"Design a settings page"

Figr's response:
A settings page that:
- Uses your left sidebar navigation pattern
- Follows your form layout conventions
- Matches your button hierarchy (primary/secondary)
- Includes your error state styling
- Uses your typography and spacing system
```
