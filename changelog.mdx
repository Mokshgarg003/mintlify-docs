## June 2025

### Version 1.4 - June 26, 2025

#### Features

- **Global Memory launched.** Tell Figr about your product once. It remembers across every canvas, forever.
- **New brainstorm mode is live.** Better ideation. Better states. More control before you jump to design.
- **Chat module shipped.** Q&A got smarter. It actually understands what you're asking.

#### Improvements

- **Better context for every state.** The last conversation pair flows into the next generation. Tighter, more relevant outputs.
- **Selection and targeted changes work.** Click what needs fixing. Change just that. No more regenerating everything.
- **Leaner context window.** Removed duplicate messages. Smaller context = sharper results = faster generations.

#### Fixes

- **Hit escape to deselect.** Finally works like you'd expect.
- **Scroll issue fixed.** That weird canvas jumping thing? Squashed.

### Version 1.4 - June 10, 2025

#### Features

- **Code export is here.** Select any artifact and hit that copy icon. Your designs, now in actual code you can ship.
- **Smarter thinking, visible thinking.** The AI shows its work now. You'll see how it gets from your brief to the final design.

#### Improvements

- **Design artifacts just show design.** No more clutter. Just the thing you asked for.
- **Your design system sticks properly.** Generated designs follow your tokens and components way more consistently.
- **Designs remember each other.** Build multiple screens? The second one learns UX patterns from the first. Your flows stay coherent.
