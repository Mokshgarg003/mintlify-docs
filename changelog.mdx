- **Web search and asset extraction.** Research competitors, pull design patterns, and extract assets from URLs directly. Figr finds what you need and integrates it into your work.
- **Gallery of real projects.** See what's possible with Figr through actual solved problems, not demos. Includes builds on existing products, research & PRDs, user flows, edge cases, UX reviews, and test cases.
- **File system sandbox.** Work with files and assets in an isolated environment for safer experimentation and iteration.
- **Pricing update**. Individual plans now start at \*\*\$19/month. \*\*Team plans start at **\$24/member.**

**Improvements**

- **Automatic mode switching.** Figr selects the appropriate mode (Chat, Design, Review) based on your request. Less manual toggling.

- **Higher quality diagrams and flows.** Improved output for flowcharts, user journeys, and technical diagrams.
- **Reliable regeneration.** "Try again" functionality now works consistently across all design types.
- **Improved performance.** Faster performance in projects with extensive artifacts and context history.

**Fixes**

**What this means:** Figr now thinks like a PM and designs like a designer. Research → Think → Design → Test. All in one place.

### Version 2.9.0 - Dec 9, 2025

<Card title="Major Release" icon="atom-simple" iconType="regular">
