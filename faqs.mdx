## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Figr different from other AI design tools?">
    Figr builds permanent product memory that learns your specific product, users, and constraints.

Figr AI is built pecifically for teams to help build on top of their existing product.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to set up Figr for my product?">
    For teams, working on a live product[ book a quick call with us](https://cal.com/moksh-figr/figr-ai-onboard) to get yourself onboarded. Initial setup takes 20 minutes. For complex products with multiple deeper context, setup may take up to an hour but delivers immediate value.\
    \
    You provide 4-5 product screenshots, your Figma tokens, CSS files or documented design system. Figr also auto-explores your product flows and sets up your design system from the backend. \
    \
    This one-time investment saves hours on every future design project as Figr applies your product knowledge automatically.\

## Features & Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Figr's memory system work?">
    Figr builds a persistent understanding of your product through four context layers: your existing flows (auto-explored), design system (tokens and components), user feedback (from uploads), and industry benchmarks. Unlike chat-based tools that forget between sessions, Figr gets smarter about your organization over time and maintains context across conversations.

    When you create new designs, Figr references this knowledge automatically. The memory builds over time, making designs increasingly accurate and context-aware.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What types of data can I import into Figr?">
    You can import user research (PDFs, videos), analytics data (CSV exports), design screenshots, and documentation (PRDs, email threads, screenshots). Figr also supports screen sharing to learn your product directly.
  </Accordion>

## Design Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How accurate are Figr's AI-generated designs?">
    Figr's accuracy depends on the context you provide. With proper design system setup and product context, teams report 50% less time fixing outputs compared to other AI tools. The designs respect your tokens, components, and existing patterns while suggesting improvements based on successful app benchmarks. 

    Initial designs typically need minor adjustments, but after a few weeks of use, designs often ship with minimal changes. The more Figr knows about your product, the better the results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I modify AI-generated designs?">
    Yes. Figr provides both AI assistance and export to Figma. You can edit any element, adjust layouts, modify colors, and make detailed refinements to get exactly what you need.\
    \
    Figr outputs production-ready frames that your designers can refine, extend, or use as starting points.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Figr handle design systems?">
    Figr reads your Figma tokens and maintains design system compliance across all outputs. It can switch between different product contexts  while applying the correct styles and components. For enterprise customers, we provide complete design system setup and auditing to ensure consistency across your organization.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if Figr creates something I don't like?">
    Simply provide feedback and ask for alternatives. Figr can generate multiple variations, explain its reasoning, or iterate based on your specific concerns. The more context you provide about what's not working, the better Figr becomes at understanding your preferences and organizational design standards.
