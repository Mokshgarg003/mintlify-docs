# Frequently Asked Questions

Quick answers to the most common questions about Figr's AI-powered design platform.

## Getting Started

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What makes Figr different from other AI design tools?">
    Figr builds permanent product memory that learns your specific product, users, and constraints. Unlike other AI tools that forget context between sessions, Figr remembers your design system, user research, and product patterns to create designs that feel native to your product from day one.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How long does it take to set up Figr for my product?">
    Initial setup takes 15-20 minutes. You'll upload your design system, share your screen to show your product, and provide basic context. This one-time investment saves hours on every future design project as Figr applies your product knowledge automatically.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do I need design experience to use Figr?">
    No. Figr is designed for product teams where non-designers need to create interface mockups. Product managers, engineers, and founders can create professional-quality designs by describing what they need in plain English.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can Figr work with my existing design tools?">
    Yes. Figr exports to Figma, Sketch, Adobe XD, and other tools. You can also export component-mapped code (React, Vue, Flutter) that uses your existing design tokens and component library.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Features & Capabilities

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How does Figr's memory system work?">
    Figr stores your design system, user research, product context, and design decisions permanently. When you create new designs, Figr references this knowledge automatically. The memory builds over time, making designs increasingly accurate and context-aware.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What types of data can I import into Figr?">
    You can import design systems (JSON, CSS, Figma files), user research (PDFs, videos), analytics data (CSV exports), screenshots, and documentation. Figr also supports screen sharing to learn your product directly.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can multiple team members collaborate in Figr?">
    Yes. Figr supports real-time collaboration with role-based permissions. Team members can co-edit designs, leave comments, and contribute to the shared product knowledge base.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Does Figr work for mobile app design?">
    Absolutely. Figr creates responsive designs and can adapt patterns across platforms. You can demo mobile apps via screen sharing, and Figr understands touch interactions, mobile navigation patterns, and device constraints.
  </Accordion>

## Technical Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What browsers does Figr support?">
    Figr works best in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge. We recommend Chrome for the best experience, especially for screen sharing features.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How secure is my data in Figr?">
    Very secure. We use AES-256 encryption, SOC 2 compliance, and enterprise-grade security practices. You maintain complete ownership of your data and can export everything anytime.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I use Figr offline?">
    Figr requires internet connection for AI features, but you can view and edit cached designs offline. Changes sync automatically when you reconnect.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does screen sharing work technically?">
    Screen sharing uses browser APIs to capture your screen in real-time. Figr processes the visual information to understand your product but doesn't record or store the sessions.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

## Design Process

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How accurate are Figr's AI-generated designs?">
    Accuracy improves with more product context. Initial designs typically need minor adjustments, but after a few weeks of use, designs often ship with minimal changes. The more Figr knows about your product, the better the results.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I modify AI-generated designs?">
    Yes. Figr provides both AI assistance and traditional design tools. You can edit any element, adjust layouts, modify colors, and make detailed refinements to get exactly what you need.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How does Figr handle design systems?">
    Figr learns your design system once and applies it consistently. It uses your actual color tokens, typography, components, and patterns in every design. You can also evolve your design system within Figr.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if Figr creates something I don't like?">
    Provide specific feedback about what to change. Figr learns from your preferences and applies them to future designs. You can also use traditional editing tools to make manual adjustments.
  </Accordion>
