## What Refine Does

Refine takes an existing design and makes specific changes. Instead of regenerating from scratch, it preserves what works and modifies what needs adjustment. Refine handles:

- Visual adjustments (colors, spacing, typography)
- Layout modifications
- Component swaps
- Content updates
- State additions
- Responsive adaptations

## [​](#when-figr-uses-refine) When Figr Uses Refine

Figr automatically engages refinement when you:

- Ask to change something in a generated design
- Request adjustments to specific elements
- Want to iterate on a concept
- Need to incorporate feedback
- Ask for variations of an existing design
