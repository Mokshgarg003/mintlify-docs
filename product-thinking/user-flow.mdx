## What Map User Flow Does

Map User Flow creates visual representations of user journeys, process flows, and system interactions. It documents paths, identifies decision points, and surfaces missing states. Map User Flow produces:

- User journey diagrams
- Process flowcharts
- Decision trees
- State diagrams
- Information architecture maps
