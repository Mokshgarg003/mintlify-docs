## What Brainstorm Does

Brainstorm helps you think through problems before jumping to solutions. It generates ideas, explores approaches, identifies considerations, and surfaces what you might miss. Brainstorm provides:

- Multiple concept directions
- Feature ideas and variations
- Edge case identification
- Pros/cons analysis
- Strategic recommendations

## From Brainstorm to Design

Brainstorm naturally flows into design.

```
Workflow:
1. "Help me think through a settings page" → Brainstorm
2. Review ideas and edge cases
3. "Design option 2 - the tabbed approach" → Prototype
4. Iterate based on brainstorm insights
```
