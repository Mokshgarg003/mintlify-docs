## Frequently Asked Questions

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What happens when I run out of credits?">
    When you exhaust your monthly credit allocation, you can either purchase additional credit packs or upgrade your plan. Free plan users can continue using manual editing features but won't have access to AI-powered design generation until the next billing cycle or credit purchase.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Do unused credits roll over?">
    Monthly subscription credits don't roll over, but purchased credit packs never expire. We recommend using subscription credits first and purchasing additional packs for overflow usage to maximize value.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Can I share credits with team members?">
    Yes, team plans allow credit sharing across all team members. You can also set individual limits and approval workflows to manage team spending effectively.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="How do I optimize credit usage?">
    The best ways to optimize include: building comprehensive product context, using design systems, batching requests, providing detailed briefs, and leveraging manual editing for small changes. Our usage analytics provide personalized optimization recommendations.
