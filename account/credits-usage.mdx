## How credits work

Every action in Figr uses credits. **Think of one credit as one hour of a designer's time.** Simple tasks use less. Complex ones use more.

| **Action in Figr**         | **What it does for you**                                                | **Typical credits used**\* | **What affects credits**                     |
| :------------------------- | :---------------------------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------- | :------------------------------------------- |
| Brainstorm & explore ideas | Generate directions, concepts, and problem‑framing from your context    | 0.1–0.5 per exploration    | Length of brief, number of ideas requested   |
| Define PRDs & flows        | Turn research into PRDs, user flows, and edge‑case maps                 | 0.5–1 per flow or PRD      | Flow complexity, number of scenarios covered |
| Generate designs           | Create screens and variations based on your PRD, flows, and constraints | 1–1.5 per screen           | Number of screens, number of variants        |
| Refine & polish designs    | Make precise edits, states, and micro‑improvements to existing designs  | 0.1-0.5 per edit           | Amount of content edited in one go           |
| Review & critique designs  | Get structured UX / product feedback on screens or flows                | 0.5–1 per review           | Number of screens, depth of critique         |
| Other AI assists           | Smaller tasks (naming, copy tweaks, summaries, etc.)                    | 0.1–0.5 per request        | Prompt length, extra context attached        |

The math is simple. Bigger, more complex work costs more credits.

## Team subscriptions

Teams share one pool of credits. **Unlimited seats.** Everyone on your team draws from the same credit pool. No need to track individual usage or worry about seat limits.

Add 5 people or 50. Zero extra cost.

## Credit rollover

Unused credits? They roll over to next month.

**But there's a cap.** You can roll over up to your monthly allocation amount. So if you get 100 credits per month, you can bank a maximum of 100 credits.

## What if I run out

Hit your limit mid-month? Upgrade to a higher plan anytime. You'll get access to more credits immediately.

  Credit consumption is dynamic. The numbers above are estimates -actual usage depends on the complexity of what you're building.
