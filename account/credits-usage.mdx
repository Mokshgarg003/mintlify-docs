## How credits work

Every action in Figr uses credits. **Think of one credit as one hour of a designer's time.** Simple tasks use less. Complex ones use more.

| Type of Task          | Credits taken |
| --------------------- | ------------- |
| Quick brainstorm      | 0.1           |
| Flow diagram          | 0.1.          |
| Design review         | 0.2           |
| Mobile screen         | 0.25-0.5      |
| Full web page         | 1-1.5         |
| Complete landing page | 1.5           |

The math is simple. Bigger, more complex work costs more credits.

## Team subscriptions

Teams share one pool of credits. **Unlimited seats.** Everyone on your team draws from the same credit pool. No need to track individual usage or worry about seat limits.

Add 5 people or 50. Zero extra cost.

## Credit rollover

Unused credits? They roll over to next month.

**But there's a cap.** You can roll over up to your monthly allocation amount. So if you get 100 credits per month, you can bank a maximum of 100 credits.

## What if I run out

Hit your limit mid-month? Upgrade to a higher plan anytime. You'll get access to more credits immediately.

<Note>
  Credit consumption is dynamic. The numbers above are estimates -actual usage depends on the complexity of what you're building.
