title: "Screen Recording"
description: "Capture real-time interactions and user flows to give Figr deep understanding of how your product actually works in motion."

## Getting Started

<video controls className="w-full rounded-xl" src="https://docs.figr.design/videos/Screen Recording.mp4" />

1. Open your Figr project
2. Click the **New Screen Share** button in the input panel
3. Select which screen or window to share
4. Click through your product naturally
5. Talk about the product and interactions
6. Stop recording when done

<Tip>
  **Narrate as you record.** Figr captures your voice and uses it as additional context. "Now I'm clicking here because users typically want to..." gives Figr intent, not just actions.

## [​](#why-screen-recording-works)Why Screen Recording Works

Static screenshots show what your product looks like. Screen recordings show how it behaves.

Figr watches you click through flows, sees transitions, notices loading states, and understands the rhythm of your product. It's the difference between seeing a photo of a car and watching someone drive it.

| **Static Inputs**                        | **Screen Recording**                             |
| ---------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------ |
| Screenshots miss interaction patterns    | Captures actual click sequences and paths        |
| Descriptions can't capture timing        | Sees loading states, transitions, animations     |
| Flow diagrams oversimplify real behavior | Records real user flow timing                    |
| Edge cases get forgotten                 | Catches the interactions you'd forget to mention |

## [​](#recording-best-practices) Best Practices

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="Narrate your Actions">
    Talk while you record. Figr uses your commentary as context.

    ```
    Good narration:
    "I'm clicking Projects because that's where users 
    typically start. Notice how the sidebar collapses 
    on smaller screens..."
    
    "This error appears because we validate emails 
    in real-time. Users often miss it if they're 
    typing quickly..."
    
    "The dashboard loads slowly with lots of data, 
    so we show skeleton components here..."
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Show, Don't Tell">
    Instead of describing what you want, show Figr examples.

    ```
    Less effective:
    "I want a form with inline validation"
    
    More effective:
    Record yourself filling out a form, triggering 
    validation errors, and correcting them. Figr 
    sees exactly how it should work.
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Record Real Data">
    Demo environments with realistic content give better results.

    ```
    Before recording:
    ✅ Populate with realistic test data
    ✅ Create multiple items to show list/table behavior
    ✅ Set up different user states to demonstrate
    ✅ Prepare error scenarios you can trigger
    ```
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Keep Recordings Focused">
    Shorter, focused recordings beat long rambling ones.

    | **Recommended appraoch**       | **Avoid**                                 |
    | ------------------------------ | ----------------------------------------- |
    | One flow per recording         | 10+ minute recordings covering everything |
    | 1-3 minutes typical length     | Jumping between unrelated features        |
    | Clear start and end points     | Excessive pauses or hesitation            |
    | Pause between distinct actions | Sensitive data on screen                  |
