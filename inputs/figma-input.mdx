## Connecting Figma

<video controls className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="https://docs.figr.design/videos/Figma Connect.mp4" />

### First-Time Setup

1. Click the Figma icon in the query box, or paste a Figma link
2. The **Connect to Figma** modal appears
3. Click **Connect to Figma** (purple button)
4. You'll be redirected to Figma's authentication page
5. Authorize Figr to access your files
6. Return to Figr with your account connected

### What Figr Accesses

```
Permissions:
✅ Read-only access to your files
✅ Process frames as input only
❌ Cannot edit your Figma files
❌ Cannot delete anything
❌ Cannot access files you don't share
```

<Tip>
  Figr only accesses connection data with your permission. You can revoke access anytime.

## Why Figma Input Matters

Screenshots lose information. When Figr analyzes an image, it estimates colors, guesses spacing, approximates radius values. Close, but not exact. Figma frames give Figr the real data.

Exact hex values. Precise spacing in pixels. Actual border radius. Real typography settings. No guessing, no approximation. Figr reads your design file directly and uses the true values.

### Screenshot Input

- Colors estimated from image pixels
- Spacing approximated visually
- Border radius guessed
- Typography inferred
- Font weights assumed

### Figma Frame Input

- Exact color values (`#6366F1`, not "purple-ish")
- Precise spacing (24px, not "about 24")
- Actual border radius (8px)
- Real typography settings
- Correct font weights and sizes

## Figma vs Screenshots

### When to Use Figma Frames

- Your own product designs
- Design system components
- Screens you want to match exactly
- Building on existing work
- Maintaining design consistency

### When Screenshots Are Fine

- Competitor analysis (you don't have their Figma)
- Quick inspiration
- External reference designs
- Live product captures

## Managing Your Connection

### Check Connection Status

Your Figma connection status shows the linked email and an option to unlink.

```
Figma account connected
your-email@company.com     [Unlink]
```

### Unlink Figma

<video controls className="w-full aspect-video rounded-xl" src="https://docs.figr.design/videos/Unlink Figma.mp4" />

To disconnect your Figma account:

1. Click **Unlink** next to your connected email
2. Confirm the disconnection
3. Your Figma access is revoked immediately

<Tip>
  You can reconnect anytime by pasting a Figma link or clicking the Figma icon.
</Tip>

### Switch Accounts

To connect a different Figma account:

1. Unlink current account
2. Paste a new Figma link
3. Authenticate with the new account

## Best Practices

### Share Specific Frames

Don't paste entire file links. Select the relevant frame.

- Link to specific dashboard frame
- Link to component you want to match
- Link to the exact screen you're extending

Avoid:

- Entire file links without context
- Page links with dozens of frames
- Outdated frames that don't reflect current design

### Combine with Prompts

Frame alone doesn't tell Figr what you want. Add context.

```
Good prompts with Figma frames:

"Match this dashboard style but create a 
settings page with these sections..."

"Use the card component from this frame 
for a new feature announcement layout"

"Keep this navigation pattern but redesign 
the content area for data visualization"
```

### Use for Design System Setup

Figma frames are ideal for setting up your design language. High-value frames to share:

- Style guide or design tokens page
- Component library frames
- Pattern documentation
- Recent approved designs
