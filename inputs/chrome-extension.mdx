## Using Captures in Figr

Once captured, your product context flows into every conversation.

### Reference in Prompts

```
Example prompts that leverage captures:

"Design a settings page that matches the navigation 
pattern from my dashboard capture"

"Create a form using the same validation approach 
I showed you in the checkout flow"

"Build a table component following the patterns 
from my existing data views"
```

### Build on Existing

Figr uses captures to extend your product, not create something generic.

```
Design request: "Add a notification center"

Without capture: Generic notification dropdown
With capture: Notification center that matches your 
nav style, uses your button variants, follows 
your spacing system, and fits your IA
```

### Market & competitive research

```
Competitor benchmarking:
Capture checkout flows from Stripe, Shopify, and Square. 
Ask Figr to design yours incorporating the best patterns 
from each.

Pattern library building:
Capture dashboard designs from Linear, Notion, and Figma. 
Build a reference set Figr can draw from for your own 
dashboard work.

Feature research:
Capture how 5 different products handle user onboarding. 
Ask Figr to analyze patterns and recommend an approach 
for your product.
```

## Why Chrome Extension Works

Most design AI asks you to describe your product. **Figr sees your actual product.**

The Chrome extension captures the real HTML structure, component hierarchy, and visual layout of any web app. Not screenshots. Not descriptions. The actual thing.

### Traditional Input

- Screenshot uploads lose interaction context
- Text descriptions miss visual patterns
- Manual specification takes hours
- Context gets lost in translation

### Figr Chrome Extension

- Captures live HTML structure and hierarchy
- Understands component relationships
- Reads styling patterns and tokens
- Sees what you actually built
